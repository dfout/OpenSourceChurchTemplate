## How To Contribute

### Fork the Repository 
- To fork the repository so you have a copy of the codebase, you will click on the **"Fork"** button from the repository main page
- Clicking on the Fork button takes you to the **"Create New Fork"** page where you select the owner (your personal github account) and click on the Create fork button.
- Connect your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote.
- Create a Branch for your own edits

**General Note:** Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
